# Hostel Management System
Hostel Management System

The Hostel Management System is a web application designed to digitize and streamline hostel operations. Instead of relying on physical registers, this system provides students and administrators with an easy-to-use platform for managing day-to-day hostel activities.

Through the platform, students can submit complaints, raise leave requests, generate night slips, and log hospital visits directly from their rooms. On the admin side, wardens and hostel staff can monitor all requests in real time, track complaint statuses, and manage hostel records more efficiently.

This project is built with a focus on speed, modern UI, and smooth user experience using the latest web technologies.
